Under development...



Since the Gallery browser/picker for the READ-COM App isn't yet ready, you can download the whole Gallery contents as a .ZIP file archive and unpack it at your computer (e.g. on the desktop) so that you'll be able to load stories and assets (when in edit mode) from it into the early versions of the app. See the "Code > Download ZIP" option on the gallery repository page at GitHub (http://github.com/Zoomicon/READCOM_Gallery)
